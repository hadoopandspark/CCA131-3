This is related to the compression codecs that exits in hadoop.
IN cloudera, below codecs are already installed
Gzip, Snappy, Bzip2 

For lzo and lzop we have to install using the GPLextra repo from cloudera
# wget http://archive.cloudera.com/gplextras5/redhat/7/x86_64/gplextras/cloudera-gplextras5.repo

# yum install lzo lzop hadoop-lzo       we have to do this on every host
after installing the packages for these codecs we have to add them into the list of codecs using cloudera manager

Go to HDFS -> Configuration. Search compression then add below codecs
com.hadoop.compression.lzo.LzopCodec
com.hadoop.compression.lzo.LzoCodec
