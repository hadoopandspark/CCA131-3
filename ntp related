If you get errors related to agent metircs are being dropped by host monitor or any other ntp related errors, install ntp on all your hosts 
# yum install ntp
# ntpdate -u -s 0.centos.pool.ntp.org 1.centos.pool.ntp.org 2.centos.pool.ntp.org
# systemctl start ntpd
# systemctl enable ntp

if this doesn't solve the issue then sync your hosts clock according to hwclock of the machine
# hwclock -w

To check if ntp is syncronized,
# timedatectl
if this shows ntp not syncronized
# timedatectl set-ntp true
